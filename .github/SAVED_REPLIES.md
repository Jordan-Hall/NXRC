## Fork: NPM install issue

```
This appears to be a problem with your node/npm setup rather than an issue with this fork of NX.

You may want to check out the [npm troubleshooting page](https://docs.npmjs.com/troubleshooting/common-errors) or [npm issue tracker](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues). If this doesn't solve your problem, consider reporting it there.

## Fork: Issue in Original NX

```
This issue stems from a recent change in NX itself, and not from this fork. We will be patching this shortly and upstreaming the fix to the original NX project. Thank you for your patience.

## Fork: Non-reproducible

```
We are unable to reproduce the problem following your provided instructions.

Please provide short, clear instructions or a minimal reproducible example. You can create a minimal repo and push it to GitHub, then link it here so we can assist further.
