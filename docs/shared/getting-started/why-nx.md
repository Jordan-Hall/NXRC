# Why Nxcc?

NxCC is a powerful fork of NX designed to enhance developer productivity by maintaining the beloved features of NX while providing more flexibility and openness. We understand the challenges developers face when configuring, maintaining, and integrating various tools and frameworks. NxCC aims to simplify this process, enabling easy scaling from individual developers to entire organizations without the complexities of low-level build tooling.
