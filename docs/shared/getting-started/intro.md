# Intro to NXCC

NXCC is a fork of NX aimed at restoring custom remote caching capabilities that have been moved behind a paywall in the original NX. This project is driven by the belief that developers, especially small and medium-sized teams, should have access to essential features without financial barriers.

## Key Features

- **Custom Remote Caching**: Restore the ability to configure your own remote caching solutions without relying on Powerpack.
- **1-to-1 Compatibility**: Fully compatible with the original NX package for a seamless transition.
- **Community-Driven Development**: Open for contributions to keep remote caching accessible to all developers.
